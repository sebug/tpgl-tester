# TPGL Tester
Adding some XCUITests to the tpgl app, but from the outside.

Inspired by: https://blog.novoda.com/getting-started-with-xcuitest-framework-for-testing-ios-apps/

Here's how you can launch it from the command line:

	xcodebuild test -project tpgl-tester.xcodeproj -scheme tpgl-tester -destination 'id=B03E2873-3519-49FD-9481-95B874A7FA2C'
